first time creating a gitfile in my macbook pro

excited to test this attempt.

great it is working with Macbook!!

change from the branch.

finally made the pull request from the pc and able to re-obtain the access
on the repository from the pc.


decided to create a branch parallel to the Master so there will be a
possibility to compare.
